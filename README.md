# SIT-Unofficial-Launcher
## Information
This was made to hopefully simplify the process of installing SIT to your Tarkov directory. The launcher will show you all possible versions of SIT and which version they are for, even warning you if your version of Tarkov does not match the one that the currently selected version of SIT is for.
## Installation
Download and extract the [launcher release](https://github.com/Lacyway/SIT-Unofficial-Launcher/releases/latest/download/SIT.Unofficial.Launcher.Desktop.exe.zip) to any folder. Always run the launcher as an administrator.
## Setting up SIT
 1. Open the launcher
 2. Go to "Settings" and click "Change" next to "Install Path" and select the path to your EFT folder.
 3. Go to "Tools" and click "Download Patcher".
 4. Select the patcher you need to run to reach the required patch for SIT.
 5. Wait for it to download and run. Repeat step 3-5 if there are more patchers required.
 6. Go to "Tools" and click "Install SIT".
 7. Select the version you want and click "Install".
 8. Once the installation is completed you can connect to the server from "Play".

Most of the logic was made originally by paulov-t. This was meant as a re-write to make it more accessible.
